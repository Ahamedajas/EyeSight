# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using Deep Learning

This project detects Diabetic Retinopathy from retinal images using ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet models with TensorFlow/Keras. It classifies images into different DR stages and evaluates model performance through accuracy and loss metrics.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `notebook.ipynb`: Training and evaluation code.
- `train/`, `valid/`, `test/`: Dataset folders.
- `model_weights/`: Saved model weights.

## ðŸ“Š Results
The notebook visualizes accuracy/loss curves and prints train/test scores.

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements
- Data augmentation
- More architectures (e.g., Vision Transformers)
- Grad-CAM visualization
